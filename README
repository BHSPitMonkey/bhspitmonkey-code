Welcome!

This is the official repository for my small projects. Nothing here 
should be considered polished, release-quality, or even important.

Unless stated otherwise, all code I publish here is under the
New BSD License.  Use it freely, don't blame me for problems with it,
and, if you want to make my day, give me a shout if you do something
with it.
